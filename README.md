# msis510-codespace
This is a personal development container definition that I am intending to use for UW Autumn 2022: MSIS 510.

## What is this?
This is a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to be used as an IDE to program in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This can be seen as an alternative to R Studio. By using GitHub Codespace, this can be an easy-to-use, reliable browser environment.

### Environment Details
This is referenced from the VS Code [R Devcontainer](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/r).

- Installs [R v4.0.3](https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocker/r-ver/4.0.3/images/sha256-c058532fe0273a5cb37898966a85b7df21e228b68158d4bcffb59fe5ec7b7767?context=explore)
- Installs VS Code [R Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)

## How to use this?
To take full advantage of the codespace, it's recommended to sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

Then, you can [fork](https://education.github.com/pack) this repository to create a copy that's your own to use it. It's important to make sure to make your own repository private if there are any assignments or you decide to check into your repo.
